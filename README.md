# Geckonator development boards

The Geckonator development boards are a series of tools for working with the USB microgontrollers from Silabs in the Happy Gecko family.

These boards have a very low component count, in part due to the built in features of the controller, eg. built in voltage regulator.

These boards are in part inspired by [Thumbinator][thumbinator] and the [Tomu][tomu] and combines parts from both of these projects.

## Hardware
The initial version of the hardware ws a small thumbdrive sized board with a male USB A connectot directly on the board and only a few LEDs.

The next version is a larger board, with a few more components, higher pincount microcontroller and a lerger prototyping area for adding other stuff.
